- **API Responses**: Mock API responses for testing data fetching

### Test Fixtures

- **Component Props**: Standard sets of props for testing components
- **Store States**: Predefined store states for testing different scenarios
- **User Events**: Predefined user event sequences for testing interactions

## Test Cases

### Button Component

1. **Rendering**:
   - Test rendering with default props
   - Test rendering with different variants
   - Test rendering with different sizes
   - Test rendering with icon
   - Test rendering when disabled
   - Test rendering with full width

2. **Interactions**:
   - Test click handler
   - Test disabled state prevents clicks
   - Test keyboard accessibility

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Test ARIA attributes
   - Test color contrast
   - Test keyboard focus styles

### Theme Store

1. **State Management**:
   - Test initial state
   - Test theme switching
   - Test persistence (if applicable)

2. **Integration**:
   - Test theme affecting UI components
   - Test theme switching from UI

### Home Page

1. **Rendering**:
   - Test rendering of all sections
   - Test rendering with different themes
   - Test responsive layout

2. **Interactions**:
   - Test theme switching
   - Test button interactions
   - Test accessibility features

## Test Reporting

3. **Accessibility Reports**:
   - Generated by jest-axe and Lighthouse
   - Published as GitHub Actions artifacts

4. **Performance Reports**:
   - Generated by Lighthouse CI
   - Published as GitHub Actions artifacts

## Entry and Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria

- Code is committed to the repository
- All dependencies are installed
- Test environment is set up

### Exit Criteria

- All tests pass
- Code coverage meets targets
- No accessibility violations
- Performance metrics meet targets

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Flaky tests causing false failures
   - **Mitigation**: Identify and fix flaky tests, use retries for network-dependent tests

2. **Risk**: Long test execution time slowing down development
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize test execution, use test filtering and parallelization

3. **Risk**: Incomplete test coverage missing critical issues
   - **Mitigation**: Regular review of test coverage, focus on critical paths

4. **Risk**: Environment-specific issues not caught in CI
   - **Mitigation**: Use multiple test environments, manual testing in different environments
