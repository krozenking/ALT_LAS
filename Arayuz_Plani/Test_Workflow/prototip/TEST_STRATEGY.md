# ALT_LAS UI Test Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the test strategy for the ALT_LAS UI. It defines the approach, scope, and methodologies for testing the UI components and features.

## Test Objectives

1. **Ensure Functionality**: Verify that all UI components and features work as expected.
2. **Ensure Quality**: Maintain high code quality and prevent regressions.
3. **Ensure Accessibility**: Ensure that the UI is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
4. **Ensure Performance**: Ensure that the UI performs well under various conditions.
5. **Ensure Compatibility**: Ensure that the UI works across different browsers and devices.

## Test Levels

### Unit Testing

- **Scope**: Individual components, functions, and hooks.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Approach**: Test each component in isolation, mocking dependencies.
- **Coverage Target**: 70% code coverage.

### Integration Testing

- **Scope**: Interactions between components, component integration with stores.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Approach**: Test components working together, focusing on data flow and interactions.
- **Coverage Target**: Key user flows and critical component interactions.

### Accessibility Testing

- **Scope**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Tools**: jest-axe, Lighthouse.
- **Approach**: Automated testing for common accessibility issues, manual testing for complex interactions.
- **Coverage Target**: All components and pages.

### Performance Testing

- **Scope**: Load time, rendering performance, bundle size.
- **Tools**: Lighthouse CI, Next.js Analytics.
- **Approach**: Automated testing for performance metrics, monitoring for regressions.
- **Coverage Target**: Key pages and critical user flows.

### End-to-End Testing

- **Scope**: Complete user flows from end to end.
- **Tools**: Cypress (to be implemented in future phases).
- **Approach**: Simulate real user interactions across multiple pages and components.
- **Coverage Target**: Critical user flows.

## Test Environments

1. **Development**: Local development environment for developers to run tests during development.
2. **CI/CD**: Automated testing environment as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **Staging**: Pre-production environment for final testing before deployment.
4. **Production**: Monitoring and smoke testing in the production environment.

## Test Data Management

1. **Mock Data**: Use mock data for unit and integration tests.
2. **Test Fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures for common test scenarios.
3. **Test Database**: Use a separate test database for end-to-end tests.

## Test Automation

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate test execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Test Reporting**: Generate and publish test reports for each test run.
3. **Coverage Reporting**: Track and report code coverage metrics.
4. **Failure Alerts**: Set up alerts for test failures in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Test Prioritization

1. **Critical Paths**: Prioritize testing of critical user flows.
2. **High-Risk Areas**: Prioritize testing of complex components and features.
3. **Recent Changes**: Prioritize testing of recently changed code.
4. **Regression Testing**: Regularly run regression tests to catch regressions.

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Developers**: Write and maintain unit and integration tests for their code.
2. **QA Engineers**: Write and maintain end-to-end tests, perform exploratory testing.
3. **UI/UX Designers**: Provide input on accessibility and usability testing.
4. **DevOps Engineers**: Set up and maintain the CI/CD pipeline for testing.

## Test Schedule

1. **Continuous Testing**: Run unit and integration tests on every commit.
2. **Daily Testing**: Run accessibility and performance tests daily.
3. **Weekly Testing**: Run end-to-end tests weekly.
4. **Release Testing**: Run all tests before each release.

## Test Deliverables

1. **Test Plans**: Detailed plans for testing specific features or releases.
2. **Test Cases**: Specific test scenarios and expected results.
3. **Test Reports**: Results of test execution, including pass/fail status and issues found.
4. **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage metrics and trends.
5. **Issue Reports**: Detailed reports of issues found during testing.

## Test Tools

1. **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration testing.
2. **React Testing Library**: Testing utilities for React components.
3. **jest-axe**: Accessibility testing for Jest.
4. **Lighthouse CI**: Performance and accessibility testing.
5. **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework (future implementation).
6. **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD platform for automated testing.
7. **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting and tracking.

## Test Metrics

1. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests.
2. **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests that pass.
3. **Test Execution Time**: Time taken to run the test suite.
4. **Issue Detection Rate**: Number of issues found by tests before release.
5. **Regression Rate**: Number of regressions detected.

## Risk Management

1. **Identified Risks**:
   - Incomplete test coverage
   - Flaky tests
   - Long test execution times
   - Environment-specific issues
   - Dependency on external services

2. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Regular review of test coverage
   - Identification and fixing of flaky tests
   - Optimization of test execution
   - Environment-specific test configurations
   - Mocking of external services

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Regular Reviews**: Review test strategy and implementation regularly.
2. **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate feedback from developers and users.
3. **Tool Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate and update testing tools.
4. **Process Improvement**: Continuously improve testing processes based on lessons learned.

## Conclusion

This test strategy provides a comprehensive approach to testing the ALT_LAS UI. By following this strategy, we aim to deliver a high-quality, accessible, and performant user interface that meets the needs of all users.
