# Distributed Model Execution

This document provides an overview of the distributed model execution system in the AI Orchestrator.

## Overview

The distributed model execution system allows AI models to be run across multiple machines, enabling:

- Horizontal scaling for handling larger workloads
- Efficient resource utilization across a cluster
- Fault tolerance and high availability
- Specialized hardware utilization (e.g., GPU nodes for specific models)

## Architecture

The system follows a distributed architecture with the following components:

1. **Nodes**: Individual machines that can run AI models
2. **Orchestrator**: Central component that manages nodes and distributes workloads
3. **Tasks**: Individual inference requests that are distributed to nodes
4. **Strategies**: Algorithms for node selection and result aggregation

### Node Discovery and Management

Nodes can dynamically join and leave the cluster. The system includes:

- Automatic node discovery using network protocols
- Health monitoring with heartbeat mechanisms
- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, GPU usage)
- Dynamic model availability tracking

### Workload Distribution

The system supports multiple strategies for distributing workloads:

- **Round Robin**: Simple rotation among available nodes
- **Least Loaded**: Select node with fewest current tasks
- **Capability Based**: Match models to nodes with appropriate hardware
- **Latency Optimized**: Select nodes with lowest response times
- **Model Specific**: Direct models to nodes specialized for them

### Execution Patterns

The system supports several execution patterns:

1. **Single Model Inference**: Run a single model on the most appropriate node
2. **Parallel Inference**: Run the same input through multiple models simultaneously
3. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple inputs efficiently across the cluster
4. **Pipeline Processing**: Chain models together with dependencies between stages

### Result Aggregation

When using parallel inference, results can be aggregated in various ways:

- **First Response**: Return as soon as any model responds
- **All Responses**: Return all model outputs
- **Majority Vote**: Use voting for classification tasks
- **Weighted Average**: Weighted combination of numeric outputs
- **Ensemble**: Sophisticated combination of model outputs

## Usage Examples

### Basic Distributed Inference

```python
# Get orchestrator
orchestrator = get_distributed_model_orchestrator()

# Start the orchestrator
await orchestrator.start()

# Create a request
request = InferenceRequest(
    model_id="llama-7b",
    inputs="What is the capital of France?",
    parameters={"temperature": 0.7}
)

# Run distributed inference
response = await orchestrator.run_distributed_inference(request)

print(response.outputs)
```

### Parallel Model Execution

```python
# Create a request
request = InferenceRequest(
    inputs="What is the capital of France?",
    parameters={"temperature": 0.7}
)

# Run parallel inference with multiple models
responses = await orchestrator.run_distributed_parallel_inference(
    request,
    model_ids=["llama-7b", "gpt-j-6b", "bloom-7b1"],
    aggregation_strategy=ResultAggregationStrategy.ALL_RESPONSES
)

# Process all responses
for response in responses:
    print(f"Model {response.model_id}: {response.outputs}")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Create multiple requests
requests = [
    InferenceRequest(model_id="llama-7b", inputs="Question 1"),
    InferenceRequest(model_id="llama-7b", inputs="Question 2"),
    InferenceRequest(model_id="gpt-j-6b", inputs="Question 3"),
    InferenceRequest(model_id="bloom-7b1", inputs="Question 4")
]

# Process batch of requests
responses = await orchestrator.run_distributed_batch_inference(requests)

# Process responses
for i, response in enumerate(responses):
    print(f"Request {i+1}: {response.outputs}")
```

### Pipeline Processing

```python
# Create requests for a pipeline
requests = [
    InferenceRequest(model_id="whisper-small", inputs="audio_data.wav"),  # Speech to text
    InferenceRequest(model_id="llama-7b", inputs=""),  # Will be filled with output from first stage
    InferenceRequest(model_id="stable-diffusion", inputs="")  # Will be filled with output from second stage
]

# Define dependencies (which stage depends on which previous stages)
dependencies = [
    [],     # First stage has no dependencies
    [0],    # Second stage depends on first stage
    [1]     # Third stage depends on second stage
]

# Run pipeline
responses = await orchestrator.run_distributed_pipeline_inference(requests, dependencies)

# Process final output
print(f"Final image generated from speech: {responses[-1].outputs}")
```

## Node Management

Administrators can manually register, update, and unregister nodes:

```python
# Register a new node
new_node = NodeInfo(
    node_id="gpu-node-1",
    hostname="gpu-server",
    ip_address="192.168.1.100",
    status=NodeStatus.ONLINE,
    capabilities={"cuda_available": True, "cuda_devices": 4},
    available_models=["stable-diffusion", "llama-7b"]
)

await orchestrator.register_node(new_node)

# Update node status
await orchestrator.update_node_status("gpu-node-1", NodeStatus.BUSY)

# Update available models
await orchestrator.update_node_models("gpu-node-1", ["stable-diffusion", "llama-7b", "whisper-large"])

# Unregister node
await orchestrator.unregister_node("gpu-node-1")
```

## Task Management

Administrators can monitor and manage tasks:

```python
# List all tasks
all_tasks = await orchestrator.list_tasks()

# List running tasks
running_tasks = await orchestrator.list_tasks(status_filter="running")

# Get specific task
task = await orchestrator.get_task("task-123")

# Cancel a task
await orchestrator.cancel_task("task-123")
```

## Configuration

The distributed execution system can be configured through settings:

- `DISCOVERY_INTERVAL`: How often to discover new nodes (seconds)
- `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`: How long before a node is considered offline (seconds)
- `DEFAULT_DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY`: Default strategy for node selection
- `DEFAULT_AGGREGATION_STRATEGY`: Default strategy for result aggregation

## Implementation Details

### Node Status Lifecycle

Nodes can be in one of the following states:
- `ONLINE`: Node is available and ready to accept tasks
- `OFFLINE`: Node is not responding or has been explicitly taken offline
- `BUSY`: Node is online but currently at capacity
- `ERROR`: Node is experiencing errors

### Task Status Lifecycle

Tasks go through the following states:
- `pending`: Task has been created but not yet started
- `running`: Task is currently being executed
- `completed`: Task has finished successfully
- `error`: Task encountered an error during execution
- `cancelled`: Task was cancelled before completion

### Fault Tolerance

The system includes several fault tolerance mechanisms:

1. **Node Failure Detection**: Heartbeat monitoring detects when nodes go offline
2. **Task Retry**: Failed tasks can be automatically retried on different nodes
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function with fewer nodes
4. **Result Validation**: Outputs can be validated before being returned

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance:

1. Match models to appropriate hardware (GPU vs CPU)
2. Use batch processing for high-throughput scenarios
3. Consider network latency when distributing tasks
4. Monitor resource usage across the cluster
5. Use appropriate distribution strategies for your workload

## Security Considerations

When deploying in production:

1. Implement proper authentication between nodes
2. Encrypt network traffic between nodes
3. Apply access controls to node registration
4. Monitor for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues
5. Isolate nodes in appropriate network segments

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the distributed execution system:

1. Integration with Kubernetes for container orchestration
2. Dynamic scaling based on workload
3. More sophisticated load balancing algorithms
4. Enhanced monitoring and observability
5. Support for federated learning across nodes
