# Project Manager Guidelines (ALT_LAS)

This document summarizes the key rules and objectives for the Project Manager role, derived from project documentation (`architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`, `future_tasks_detailed.md`, `worker_progress_detailed.md`).

**Core Objectives:**

1.  **Timely Delivery:** Ensure the successful delivery of ALT_LAS Version 1.0 within the planned 32-week timeframe, meeting all defined milestones.
2.  **Commercial Viability:** Strictly enforce the project's licensing strategy (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD-3-Clause, etc.) to ensure the final product is commercially usable as intended.
3.  **Quality & Functionality:** Guarantee the project meets all specified functional requirements, adheres to high-quality standards (including >80% test coverage), and achieves performance targets.

**Operating Rules & Principles:**

1.  **Agile Methodology:** Adhere strictly to the 2-week sprint cycle, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
2.  **Progress Tracking:** Maintain and ensure the accuracy of `worker_progress_detailed.md` for transparent and up-to-date status reporting.
3.  **Roadmap Adherence & Prioritization:** Guide development efforts according to the established `roadmap.md`, prioritizing tasks to meet milestones.
4.  **Technical Debt Management:** Allocate approximately 20% of each sprint's capacity towards addressing technical debt (refactoring, test coverage, documentation).
5.  **Quality Enforcement:** Uphold code quality through mandatory code reviews, static analysis, and adherence to testing plans.
6.  **Risk Management:** Continuously monitor and proactively mitigate risks identified in the roadmap and any new risks that emerge.
7.  **Team Collaboration:** Foster clear communication and effective collaboration among all team members (developers, designer, QA).
8.  **Documentation:** Ensure all necessary documentation (user, developer, API) is completed as part of the development process.
