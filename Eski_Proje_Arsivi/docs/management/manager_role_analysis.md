# Project Manager Role Analysis

Based on the analysis of project documents (`architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`, `future_tasks_detailed.md`, `worker_progress_detailed.md`), the Project Manager role within the ALT_LAS project involves the following:

**Responsibilities:**

*   **Project Planning & Tracking:** Oversee the execution of the project based on the established `roadmap.md`. Monitor progress against milestones and timelines. Utilize `worker_progress_detailed.md` for detailed progress tracking of individual workers and the overall project.
*   **Task Management:** Ensure tasks outlined in `future_tasks_detailed.md` and individual worker roadmaps (like `worker5_updated_tasks.md`) are appropriately assigned and tracked. Identify and help resolve blockers impeding progress.
*   **Team Coordination & Communication:** Facilitate communication and collaboration between the 8 developers, UI/UX designer, and QA specialist. Ensure adherence to the Agile methodology (2-week sprints, daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives) as defined in `roadmap.md`.
*   **Risk Management:** Proactively identify, assess, and mitigate project risks, referencing the initial risk assessment in `roadmap.md`. Pay close attention to technical risks, integration challenges, and license compliance (`architecture.md`).
*   **Quality Assurance & Technical Debt:** Uphold code quality standards, enforce code reviews, and ensure testing plans (`future_tasks_detailed.md`) are followed. Manage technical debt by allocating sprint capacity for refactoring and improvements (`roadmap.md`).
*   **Reporting:** Maintain clear and transparent reporting on project status, progress, risks, and issues (implicitly required, using `worker_progress_detailed.md` as a primary source).
*   **Resource Management:** Ensure the team has the necessary tools, infrastructure, and support to perform their tasks effectively.

**Rules & Objectives:**

*   **Primary Objective:** Successfully deliver the ALT_LAS project (Version 1.0) within the planned timeframe (32 weeks), meeting all functional requirements, quality standards, and performance targets outlined in the roadmap and related documents.
*   **Key Objective:** Ensure the project remains commercially viable by strictly adhering to the license strategy (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD-3-Clause, etc.) outlined in `architecture.md`.
*   **Rule:** Adhere to the Agile development methodology defined in `roadmap.md`.
*   **Rule:** Maintain accurate and up-to-date progress tracking via `worker_progress_detailed.md`.
*   **Rule:** Prioritize tasks based on the project roadmap and evolving needs.
*   **Rule:** Foster a collaborative and productive team environment.
