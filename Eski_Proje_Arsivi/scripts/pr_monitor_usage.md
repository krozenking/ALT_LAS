# Pull Request Monitoring Usage Guide
# This document explains how to use the enhanced pull request monitoring script

# Overview
# The enhanced_pr_monitor.sh script checks for pull requests in the ALT_LAS repository,
# analyzes them for security implications, and logs them for review.

# Prerequisites
# - GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope permissions
# - Bash shell environment

# Setup
# 1. Set your GitHub token as an environment variable:
#    export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
#
# 2. Make the script executable (if not already):
#    chmod +x scripts/enhanced_pr_monitor.sh
#
# 3. Run the script:
#    ./scripts/enhanced_pr_monitor.sh

# Output Files
# - pr_monitoring.log: Contains detailed logs of all pull requests
# - pr_security_analysis.md: Contains security analysis of dependency updates

# Automation
# To automatically check pull requests after each push, add this to your post-push hook
# or CI/CD pipeline.

# Example post-push hook:
# #!/bin/bash
# export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
# cd /path/to/repository
# ./scripts/enhanced_pr_monitor.sh

# Security Notes
# - Never hardcode your GitHub token in scripts or commit it to the repository
# - Store your token securely and use environment variables
# - Consider using GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD integration
