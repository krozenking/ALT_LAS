This service is responsible for interpreting, scheduling, and executing workflows defined within the ALT_LAS platform.

## Responsibilities

-   Parse workflow definitions (nodes, edges, configurations).
-   Manage workflow state (running, completed, failed).
-   Execute individual nodes (pieces) based on workflow logic and dependencies.
-   Handle triggers (manual, scheduled, webhook).
-   Provide APIs for managing and monitoring workflows.

## Technology Stack (Initial)

-   Python
-   FastAPI
-   (Potentially) Celery/Redis for task queuing and scheduling
-   (Potentially) Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing workflow definitions and execution history
