**Title:** Why so many distros? The Weird History of Linux

**Channel:** Fireship

**Notes:**
This video from Fireship explores the history of Linux and the reasons behind the existence of numerous Linux distributions. The description mentions taking a "brief journey through the history of Linux to understand hundreds of different distros exist today." While Linux is a prevalent operating system for CUDA development, this video focuses on the historical and ecosystem aspects of Linux itself, rather than directly on CUDA or GPU programming. It provides context on the Linux environment where CUDA is often used.
