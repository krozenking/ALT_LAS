**Title:** Mind-bending new programming language for GPUs just dropped...

**Channel:** Fireship

**Notes:**
This video from Fireship discusses a new programming language called Bend, designed for parallel computing on GPUs. The description highlights that Bend uses a Python-like syntax to write high-performance code that can run on the GPU. This suggests the video explores alternatives or newer approaches to GPU programming beyond traditional CUDA C/C++.
