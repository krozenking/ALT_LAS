**Title:** 100+ Linux Things you Need to Know

**Channel:** Fireship

**Notes:**
This video from Fireship, titled "100+ Linux Things you Need to Know," appears to be a general overview of Linux concepts. The description mentions learning "101 essential concepts in Linux in 10 minutes" and touches upon topics like the Linux kernel and GNU. While Linux is a common environment for CUDA development, this video itself does not seem to be directly focused on CUDA programming but rather on general Linux knowledge.
