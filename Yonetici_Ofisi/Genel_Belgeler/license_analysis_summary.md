# License Compatibility Analysis for Commercial Closed-Source Distribution

This document analyzes the licenses of identified libraries and modules for the ALT_LAS project, focusing on their compatibility with commercial, closed-source distribution as per the user's requirement. The term "free" is interpreted as allowing royalty-free distribution and use in proprietary, closed-source software.

## 1. Core Technologies & SDKs

*   **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (including cuBLAS, cuFFT, cuDNN, Thrust, etc.)**
    *   **License:** NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit EULA.
    *   **Analysis:** The EULA generally permits the distribution of applications developed using the CUDA Toolkit. Runtime libraries (e.g., `cudart.dll`, `cublas.dll`) are typically redistributable with the application, subject to the terms of the EULA. The EULA should be reviewed for specific redistribution rights and any notice requirements. No royalty fees are typically associated with distributing applications built with CUDA.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Likely Compatible (Review EULA for specifics on redistributables).**

*   **NVIDIA Drivers**
    *   **License:** NVIDIA Software License Agreement.
    *   **Analysis:** End-users typically download and install drivers themselves. Distributing NVIDIA drivers directly with a commercial product is generally not permitted or practical. The application will rely on the user having appropriate drivers installed.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Not Applicable for direct redistribution (application relies on user-installed drivers).**

*   **NVIDIA Nsight Suite (Systems, Compute, Graphics)**
    *   **License:** NVIDIA Software License Agreement.
    *   **Analysis:** These are development tools and are not typically redistributed with the end-product. Their use during development does not restrict the licensing of the developed application.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible (as development tools, not redistributed).**

*   **NVIDIA TensorRT**
    *   **License:** NVIDIA TensorRT EULA.
    *   **Analysis:** The TensorRT runtime libraries are generally redistributable with applications, similar to CUDA runtime libraries, subject to EULA terms. This allows optimized models to be deployed in commercial, closed-source applications.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Likely Compatible (Review EULA for specifics on redistributables).**

*   **NVIDIA Container Toolkit**
    *   **License:** Primarily Apache 2.0 for many components, with some parts under NVIDIA EULA.
    *   **Analysis:** Used for building and running GPU-accelerated Docker containers. The toolkit itself is not part of the distributed application but facilitates its deployment. Apache 2.0 components are permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible (as a deployment tool).**

*   **NVIDIA DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager)**
    *   **License:** NVIDIA EULA.
    *   **Analysis:** Used for monitoring and managing GPUs in data centers. If any part of DCGM (e.g., client libraries) were to be bundled, the EULA would need careful review. Typically, it's a separate infrastructure tool.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Likely Compatible (if used as a separate tool, review EULA if any components are bundled).**

## 2. Programming Languages & Compilers

*   **Python**
    *   **License:** Python Software Foundation License (PSF).
    *   **Analysis:** A permissive, GPL-compatible license that allows for commercial, closed-source distribution of Python applications.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

*   **C/C++ Compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC)**
    *   **GCC:** GPL with runtime library exception. The exception allows linking GCC's runtime libraries with proprietary code.
    *   **Clang:** Apache License 2.0 (compiler) and various licenses for its runtime libraries (e.g., LLVM exceptions to Apache 2.0, or BSD/MIT for libc++).
    *   **MSVC:** Microsoft specific EULA. Generally allows distribution of compiled binaries built with it.
    *   **Analysis:** All are generally suitable for developing commercial, closed-source applications.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

## 3. AI/ML Frameworks & Libraries

*   **TensorFlow**
    *   **License:** Apache 2.0.
    *   **Analysis:** Permissive license, allows commercial, closed-source use and distribution.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

*   **PyTorch**
    *   **License:** BSD-style (modified).
    *   **Analysis:** Permissive license, allows commercial, closed-source use and distribution.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

*   **Llama.cpp**
    *   **License:** MIT License.
    *   **Analysis:** Permissive license, allows commercial, closed-source use and distribution.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

*   **CuPy**
    *   **License:** MIT License.
    *   **Analysis:** Permissive license, allows commercial, closed-source use and distribution.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

*   **Numba (CUDA features)**
    *   **License:** BSD 2-Clause.
    *   **Analysis:** Permissive license, allows commercial, closed-source use and distribution.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

*   **RAPIDS (cuML, cuDF)**
    *   **License:** Apache 2.0.
    *   **Analysis:** Permissive license, allows commercial, closed-source use and distribution.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

## 4. Development & Testing Tools

*   **Python cProfile, Py-Spy**
    *   **License:** PSF (cProfile), MIT (Py-Spy).
    *   **Analysis:** Development tools, not typically redistributed. Licenses are permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible (as development tools).**

*   **Google Test**
    *   **License:** BSD 3-Clause.
    *   **Analysis:** Testing framework, not typically redistributed. License is permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible (as a testing tool).**

*   **PyTest**
    *   **License:** MIT License.
    *   **Analysis:** Testing framework, not typically redistributed. License is permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible (as a testing tool).**

## 5. Deployment & Orchestration

*   **Docker**
    *   **License:** Apache 2.0 (for Docker Engine).
    *   **Analysis:** Deployment tool. License is permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible (as a deployment tool).**

*   **Kubernetes**
    *   **License:** Apache 2.0.
    *   **Analysis:** Orchestration tool. License is permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible (as an orchestration tool).**

*   **NVIDIA Device Plugin for Kubernetes**
    *   **License:** Apache 2.0.
    *   **Analysis:** Facilitates GPU use in Kubernetes. License is permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

## 6. Monitoring & Visualization Tools

*   **Prometheus**
    *   **License:** Apache 2.0.
    *   **Analysis:** Permissive. If client libraries are bundled, they are also typically Apache 2.0.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Compatible.**

*   **Grafana**
    *   **License:** AGPLv3 for Grafana OSS; Apache 2.0 for Grafana Enterprise (requires commercial license from Grafana Labs).
    *   **Analysis:** **AGPLv3 is highly problematic for commercial, closed-source distribution.** If Grafana OSS is distributed as part of the ALT_LAS product, or if the product is considered a derivative work (e.g., by embedding or deeply integrating Grafana OSS UI components and distributing them), the entire ALT_LAS product might be required to be licensed under AGPLv3. This conflicts with the closed-source goal.
        *   Using Grafana OSS internally for monitoring (not distributed) is fine.
        *   Linking to a separate, user-deployed Grafana OSS instance is fine.
        *   Using Grafana Enterprise requires a commercial agreement with Grafana Labs.
        *   Client libraries used to *send data to* Grafana/Prometheus are usually permissively licensed (e.g., Apache 2.0) and are fine to bundle.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Potentially Incompatible (if Grafana OSS is distributed or deeply integrated). Requires careful consideration of usage and potential alternatives if direct bundling/derivation is planned.**

## 7. Web Technologies

*   **WebGPU**
    *   **License:** Web standard; browser implementations (e.g., Dawn in Chrome - Apache 2.0, wgpu in Firefox - MPL 2.0) are permissively licensed.
    *   **Analysis:** If the project uses WebGPU via a browser, the browser's license applies to that component. If a standalone WebGPU library were to be bundled (e.g., in an Electron app), that specific library's license would need checking, but they are typically permissive.
    *   **Compatibility:** **Likely Compatible.**

## Summary of Key Considerations:

1.  **NVIDIA EULAs:** While generally supportive of distributing applications built with their tools, the specific EULAs for CUDA Toolkit, TensorRT, and any other directly bundled NVIDIA runtime components should be reviewed by legal counsel to ensure full compliance with redistribution terms and any notice requirements.
2.  **Grafana OSS (AGPLv3):** This is the most significant licensing concern identified. If the project intends to distribute Grafana OSS dashboards or UI components as an integrated part of the closed-source commercial product, this is likely not feasible under AGPLv3. Alternatives would be: 
    *   Using Grafana Enterprise (commercial license).
    *   Building custom dashboards using permissively licensed charting libraries.
    *   Having users connect to their own Grafana instances.
    *   Ensuring any interaction is via APIs and no AGPL code is part of the distributed product.
3.  **Permissive Licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD):** The majority of the open-source tools (Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, RAPIDS, etc.) use permissive licenses that are well-suited for commercial, closed-source products. These generally require attribution.

**Recommendation:** A legal review of NVIDIA EULAs is advisable. The use and integration strategy for Grafana needs to be clarified; if bundling or creating a derivative work of Grafana OSS is planned, an alternative approach or a commercial Grafana license will be necessary.
