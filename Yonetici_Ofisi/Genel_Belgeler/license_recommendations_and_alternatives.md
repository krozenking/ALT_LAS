# Recommendations for Incompatible or Risky Licenses

This document provides recommendations and alternatives for libraries identified with potentially incompatible licenses for commercial, closed-source distribution of the ALT_LAS project, based on the analysis in `license_analysis_summary.md`.

## 1. Grafana OSS (AGPLv3 License)

The AGPLv3 license of Grafana OSS poses a significant risk if the project intends to distribute Grafana OSS dashboards or UI components as an integrated part of a closed-source commercial product. Distributing or creating a derivative work of AGPLv3-licensed software generally requires the entire product to be licensed under AGPLv3, which conflicts with the closed-source goal.

**Recommendations & Alternatives:**

1.  **Use Grafana Enterprise:** Obtain a commercial license from Grafana Labs for Grafana Enterprise. This version is designed for commercial use and does not have the AGPLv3 restrictions for distribution.
    *   **Pros:** Full Grafana functionality, official support.
    *   **Cons:** Licensing costs.

2.  **Build Custom Dashboards:** Develop custom dashboarding and visualization capabilities within the ALT_LAS application using permissively licensed charting libraries. 
    *   **Examples of Permissively Licensed Charting Libraries:**
        *   **Apache ECharts (Apache 2.0):** A powerful, free, and open-source charting and visualization library.
        *   **Chart.js (MIT License):** Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers & developers.
        *   **D3.js (BSD 3-Clause License):** A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data, highly flexible for custom visualizations.
    *   **Pros:** Full control over UI/UX, no restrictive licensing issues from the dashboarding component itself.
    *   **Cons:** Development effort and time required to build custom dashboards.

3.  **User-Managed Grafana Instance:** Design the ALT_LAS project to integrate with a Grafana instance managed and deployed by the end-user. The ALT_LAS product would then only send data to this external Grafana instance (e.g., via Prometheus as a data source) or provide links/guidance on how to set up dashboards.
    *   **Pros:** Avoids distributing Grafana OSS. Shifts responsibility of Grafana licensing to the user.
    *   **Cons:** Less integrated user experience; relies on the user to set up and manage Grafana.

4.  **API-Only Interaction with Grafana (If applicable):** If the interaction with Grafana is purely through APIs (e.g., ALT_LAS pushes data to Grafana, or pulls aggregated data from Grafana APIs without embedding Grafana's UI or distributing its code), this *might* be acceptable. However, this requires careful legal scrutiny to ensure no part of the AGPLv3 code is considered part of the distributed product or that the product is not considered a derivative work.
    *   **Pros:** Potentially leverages existing Grafana instances.
    *   **Cons:** High legal risk if not structured correctly; limited integration possibilities.

**Recommended Action for Grafana:** Clarify the intended level of integration with Grafana. If deep integration or distribution of dashboarding capabilities is required, pursuing custom dashboards with permissive libraries (Option 2) or obtaining a Grafana Enterprise license (Option 1) are the safest routes for a commercial, closed-source product.

## 2. NVIDIA EULAs (CUDA Toolkit, TensorRT, etc.)

While NVIDIA EULAs generally permit the distribution of applications developed using their SDKs (like CUDA Toolkit and TensorRT runtime libraries), these are legal agreements with specific terms and conditions.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Mandatory Legal Review:** It is strongly recommended that legal counsel reviews all applicable NVIDIA EULAs (CUDA Toolkit, TensorRT, DCGM if bundled, etc.) before any commercial distribution of the ALT_LAS project. This review should confirm:
    *   Specific rights and limitations for redistributing runtime libraries and other components.
    *   Any notice requirements (e.g., including NVIDIA copyright notices or EULA text with the distributed product).
    *   Compliance with any other obligations imposed by the EULAs.
2.  **Clear Identification of Redistributables:** Ensure the development team clearly identifies which specific NVIDIA runtime libraries are being packaged and distributed with the ALT_LAS application. This list should be provided to legal counsel for review against the EULAs.

## 3. General Permissive Licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)

Most other identified libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, RAPIDS, CuPy, Llama.cpp, Numba, etc.) use permissive licenses like Apache 2.0, MIT, or BSD.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Attribution Requirements:** While these licenses allow for commercial, closed-source use, they typically have attribution requirements (e.g., including a copy of the license text or acknowledging the use of the software in documentation). Ensure these requirements are met.
2.  **Verify Specific Versions:** Always ensure that the specific versions of the libraries being used are indeed covered by the expected permissive license, as licenses can occasionally change between versions (though rare for established projects).

By addressing these points, particularly the Grafana AGPLv3 issue and conducting a legal review of NVIDIA EULAs, the ALT_LAS project can better ensure compliance with its goal of commercial, closed-source distribution using freely licensed components.
