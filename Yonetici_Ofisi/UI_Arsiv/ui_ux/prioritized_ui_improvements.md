# Prioritized UI/UX Improvements (ALT_LAS)

**Source:** `/home/ubuntu/selected_ui_improvements.md`
**Prioritized By:** Project Manager

Based on the selected UI/UX improvements and the current project status, the following prioritization has been established to guide implementation, primarily for Worker 5 (UI Developer):

**Priority 1 (Highest): Panel System - Usability Enhancements**
*   **Task 1.1:** Implement enhanced visual feedback during panel drag-and-drop and resizing operations (e.g., highlighted drop zones, ghost panels).
*   **Task 1.2:** Define and implement keyboard shortcuts for navigating between panels, resizing panels, and initiating drag/drop actions.
*   **Rationale:** Core usability and accessibility improvements for a fundamental UI interaction pattern. Critical for making the UI functional and accessible from the start.

**Priority 2 (High): Glassmorphism Effects - Consistency & Accessibility**
*   **Task 2.1:** Develop a clear style guide defining parameters (blur, opacity, radius) for consistent application of glassmorphism.
*   **Task 2.2:** Review glassmorphism implementation against WCAG contrast and readability guidelines. Define adjustments or alternatives for high-contrast themes.
*   **Rationale:** Establishes visual consistency and addresses potential accessibility blockers early in the UI development cycle.

**Priority 3 (Medium): Theme System - Mode Integration**
*   **Task 3.1:** Implement distinct visual variations within the theme system for the different operating modes (Normal, Dream, Explore, Chaos), potentially including subtle animation or styling differences.
*   **Rationale:** Aligns with existing plans for theme development and adds value by making system modes clearer to the user. Can be worked on after core panel usability and consistency are addressed.

**Priority 4 (Medium): Command Bar - Interaction Feedback**
*   **Task 4.1:** Implement visual feedback (e.g., loading indicator) within the command bar during command processing.
*   **Task 4.2:** Design and implement user-friendly error messages for invalid commands or backend processing errors.
*   **Rationale:** Important for user experience but requires coordination with backend services (potentially Runner Service or AI Orchestrator). Can be addressed once the basic UI structure is more established and backend interactions are clearer.

**Next Step:** Assign these prioritized tasks to the appropriate workers, primarily Worker 5, updating their task lists.
