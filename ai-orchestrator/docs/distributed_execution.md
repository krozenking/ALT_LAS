# Distributed Model Execution and Enhanced Model Selection

This document provides an overview of the distributed model execution and enhanced model selection features implemented for the AI Orchestrator component of the ALT_LAS project.

## Distributed Model Execution

The distributed model execution system allows AI models to be run across multiple machines, enabling more efficient resource utilization and the ability to handle larger models that may not fit on a single machine.

### Key Components

#### DistributedModelOrchestrator

The main orchestrator class that manages distributed model execution across multiple nodes. It provides the following functionality:

- **Node Discovery**: Automatically discovers other nodes in the network that can run models
- **Workload Distribution**: Intelligently distributes model execution tasks across available nodes
- **Result Aggregation**: Collects and aggregates results from distributed model executions

#### Node Management

The system tracks information about each node in the distributed network:

- **NodeInfo**: Contains details about each compute node, including:
  - Hardware capabilities (CPU, memory, GPU)
  - Available models
  - Current load and status
  - Performance metrics

#### Distribution Strategies

Several strategies are available for distributing workloads:

- **ROUND_ROBIN**: Simple round-robin distribution across nodes
- **LEAST_LOADED**: Sends tasks to the node with the fewest current tasks
- **MODEL_SPECIFIC**: Prioritizes nodes that already have the required model loaded
- **CAPABILITY_BASED**: Selects nodes based on their hardware capabilities
- **LATENCY_OPTIMIZED**: Prioritizes nodes with lower average response times

### Usage Examples

```python
# Get the distributed orchestrator
from ai_orchestrator.core.distributed import get_distributed_orchestrator

orchestrator = get_distributed_orchestrator()

# Run inference on a distributed node
response = await orchestrator.run_distributed_inference(
    request,
    strategy=DistributionStrategy.CAPABILITY_BASED
)

# Run parallel inference across multiple nodes
responses = await orchestrator.run_distributed_parallel_inference(
    request,
    model_ids=["model1", "model2", "model3"]
)
```

## Enhanced Model Selection

The enhanced model selection system provides advanced algorithms for selecting the most appropriate model(s) for a given task, considering factors beyond basic model capabilities.

### Key Components

#### EnhancedModelOrchestrator

Extends the base ModelOrchestrator with advanced selection strategies and optimized parallel execution:

- **Advanced Selection Strategies**: More sophisticated algorithms for model selection
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors and learns from model performance over time
- **Optimized Parallel Execution**: Improved parallel execution with features like early stopping and timeouts

#### Advanced Selection Strategies

Several advanced strategies are available:

- **MULTI_OBJECTIVE**: Balances multiple objectives like accuracy, speed, and cost
- **ADAPTIVE**: Learns from historical performance to improve selection over time
- **CONTEXT_AWARE**: Considers input context (e.g., input length, language) when selecting models
- **HYBRID**: Combines multiple strategies for better results
- **SPECIALIZED**: Selects models specialized for specific task subtypes

### Usage Examples

```python
# Get the enhanced orchestrator
from ai_orchestrator.core.model_selection import get_enhanced_orchestrator

orchestrator = get_enhanced_orchestrator()

# Select models using advanced strategies
model_ids = await orchestrator.select_models_advanced(
    task_type="text-generation",
    strategy=AdvancedModelSelectionStrategy.CONTEXT_AWARE,
    context={"input_length": 5000, "language": "en"}
)

# Run optimized parallel inference
responses = await orchestrator.run_optimized_parallel_inference(
    request,
    model_ids=["model1", "model2", "model3"],
    timeout=5.0,
    early_stopping=True
)
```

## Integration with Existing System

Both the distributed model execution and enhanced model selection systems integrate seamlessly with the existing AI Orchestrator:

- They use the same model manager for model information and loading
- They follow the same request/response patterns
- They can be used alongside the existing orchestration functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Distributed Execution

- **Network Overhead**: Distributed execution introduces network latency
- **Load Balancing**: The system attempts to balance load across nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system handles node failures gracefully

### Enhanced Selection

- **Selection Overhead**: More sophisticated selection strategies may take longer to select models
- **Learning Curve**: Adaptive strategies improve over time as they learn from performance history
- **Memory Usage**: Tracking performance history and usage statistics requires additional memory

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

- **Improved Node Discovery**: Using industry-standard service discovery mechanisms
- **Model Sharding**: Splitting large models across multiple nodes
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed model training and fine-tuning
- **More Advanced Selection Strategies**: Incorporating reinforcement learning for model selection
- **User Feedback Integration**: Learning from user feedback on model outputs

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites are provided for both systems:

- **test_distributed.py**: Tests for distributed model execution
- **test_model_selection.py**: Tests for enhanced model selection

Run the tests using pytest:

```bash
cd ai-orchestrator
python -m pytest src/tests/test_distributed.py src/tests/test_model_selection.py -v
```
