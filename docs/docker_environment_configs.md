# Docker Environment Configuration Documentation

This document outlines the secure Docker configurations implemented for different environments in the ALT_LAS project.

## Overview

Secure Docker configurations have been implemented for the following environments:
- Development
- Test
- Staging
- Production

Each environment has specific security considerations and configurations tailored to its purpose.

## Common Security Features

All environment configurations include the following security features:

1. **Multi-stage builds** - Separates build dependencies from runtime dependencies
2. **Minimal base images** - Uses slim variants to reduce attack surface
3. **Dependency management** - Proper handling of dependencies with version pinning
4. **Proper file permissions** - Directories and files have appropriate permissions
5. **Clean-up operations** - Removes unnecessary files and build artifacts

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### Production Environment

The production environment prioritizes security and stability:

- **Non-root user execution** - Application runs as non-privileged user
- **Minimal installed packages** - Only essential runtime dependencies
- **Strict permissions** - Least privilege principle applied
- **Healthcheck capability** - Monitors application health
- **Optimized for performance** - No development tools or debugging features

### Staging Environment

The staging environment closely mirrors production with some monitoring additions:

- **Non-root user execution** - Application runs as non-privileged user
- **Minimal debugging tools** - Basic tools for troubleshooting
- **Healthcheck implementation** - Active monitoring of application health
- **Environment-specific variables** - Configured for staging data and services

### Test Environment

The test environment is configured for automated testing:

- **Non-root user execution** - Application runs as non-privileged user
- **Testing tools included** - Necessary tools for running tests
- **Test-specific configuration** - Environment variables set for testing
- **Default test command** - Runs test suite by default

### Development Environment

The development environment prioritizes developer experience while maintaining security:

- **Development tools included** - Tools for debugging and development
- **Hot-reload capability** - Code changes reflected immediately
- **Verbose logging** - More detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Root access preserved** - For debugging purposes only in development

## Implementation Details

The Docker configurations use best practices including:

1. **Layer optimization** - Minimizes the number and size of layers
2. **Proper COPY instructions** - Only necessary files are copied
3. **Specific version tags** - Avoids using 'latest' tag for reproducibility
4. **Environment variable management** - Properly configured for each environment
5. **Port exposure** - Only necessary ports are exposed

## Security Considerations

These configurations address several security concerns:

1. **Reduced attack surface** - Minimal packages and dependencies
2. **Principle of least privilege** - Non-root users with minimal permissions
3. **Supply chain security** - Pinned dependencies and verified sources
4. **Resource constraints** - Appropriate resource allocation
5. **Isolation** - Proper separation between environments

## Usage Instructions

To build and run containers for different environments:

```bash
# Build for specific environment
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t alt-las/ai-orchestrator:dev .
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t alt-las/ai-orchestrator:test .
docker build -f Dockerfile.staging -t alt-las/ai-orchestrator:staging .
docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t alt-las/ai-orchestrator:prod .

# Run container for specific environment
docker run -p 8000:8000 alt-las/ai-orchestrator:dev
```
