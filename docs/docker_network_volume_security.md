# Docker Network and Volume Security Best Practices
# Created by Worker 8 (Security and DevOps Specialist)

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for securing Docker networks and volumes within the ALT_LAS project, complementing the secure Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations.

## Network Security

### 1. Use Custom Bridge Networks
- **Rationale**: Avoid using the default `bridge` network. Custom networks provide better isolation and enable container name resolution.
- **Implementation**: Define custom networks in `docker-compose.yml` (as already done in `docker-compose.secure.yml` with `alt_las_network`).

### 2. Minimize Exposed Ports
- **Rationale**: Only expose ports that are absolutely necessary for external access (e.g., API Gateway). Service-to-service communication should happen over the internal Docker network.
- **Implementation**: Review the `ports` section in `docker-compose.secure.yml`. Ensure only the API Gateway or other necessary entry points expose ports to the host.

### 3. Use `internal: true` for Internal Networks
- **Rationale**: If a network is purely for internal communication between services and should not have external connectivity, mark it as internal.
- **Implementation**: Consider if `alt_las_network` should be internal. If external access is only needed via the API Gateway, other services might not need direct external routing.
  ```yaml
  networks:
    alt_las_internal_network:
      driver: bridge
      internal: true
  ```

### 4. Consider Network Segmentation
- **Rationale**: For larger applications, segment services into multiple networks based on their function or trust level (e.g., frontend, backend, database networks).
- **Implementation**: Evaluate if the current single `alt_las_network` is sufficient or if further segmentation would enhance security.

### 5. Use Docker Swarm/Kubernetes Network Policies
- **Rationale**: For more granular control, especially in production, use network policies (available in Swarm or Kubernetes) to define exactly which services can communicate with each other.
- **Implementation**: This is part of the Kubernetes integration tasks. Define `NetworkPolicy` resources in Kubernetes to restrict traffic flow.

## Volume Security

### 1. Use Named Volumes Over Bind Mounts for Data Persistence
- **Rationale**: Named volumes are managed by Docker, stored within the Docker host's filesystem (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/`), are easier to back up, and don't depend on the host's directory structure. Bind mounts can expose host filesystem paths and potentially sensitive data.
- **Implementation**: Use named volumes for database data, application state, etc. (as done for `postgres_data`, `prometheus_data`, etc., in `docker-compose.secure.yml`). Avoid bind-mounting sensitive host directories.

### 2. Mount Volumes Read-Only Where Possible
- **Rationale**: If a container only needs to read data from a volume or configuration file, mount it read-only (`:ro`) to prevent accidental or malicious modification.
- **Implementation**: Applied in `docker-compose.secure.yml` for configuration files (e.g., Prometheus config). Review all volume mounts and apply `:ro` where applicable.

### 3. Be Cautious with Bind Mounts for Code Development
- **Rationale**: While convenient for development (reflecting code changes immediately), bind-mounting source code can have security implications if host files are inadvertently exposed or modified. It also bypasses the image build process.
- **Implementation**: Use bind mounts for development only. Production containers should use code baked into the image. The `docker-compose.secure.yml` removes development-specific bind mounts.

### 4. Secure the Docker Socket (`docker.sock`)
- **Rationale**: Mounting the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into a container gives it full control over the Docker daemon, which is a major security risk. Avoid this unless absolutely necessary (e.g., for specific Docker management tools) and apply strict access controls.
- **Implementation**: Ensure `docker.sock` is not mounted in any service unless explicitly required and approved after a security review.

### 5. Use Volume Drivers for Advanced Features
- **Rationale**: Explore Docker volume drivers for features like backups, encryption, or mounting cloud storage.
- **Implementation**: Research and implement appropriate volume drivers based on specific needs (e.g., `local-persist` for backups, drivers for NFS, AWS EBS, etc.).

### 6. Regularly Back Up Named Volumes
- **Rationale**: Persistent data in named volumes should be backed up regularly.
- **Implementation**: Implement a backup strategy for critical volumes like `postgres_data`, `influxdb_data`, etc. This can involve Docker commands (`docker run --rm -v volume_name:/data -v /path/to/backup:/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /data`) or volume driver features.

## Conclusion
Applying these network and volume security best practices, in conjunction with secure images and runtime configurations, significantly enhances the overall security posture of the ALT_LAS application deployed using Docker.
