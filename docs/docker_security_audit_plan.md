# Docker Security Audit Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for conducting regular Docker security audits in the ALT_LAS project. Regular security audits are essential to maintain the security posture of containerized applications and infrastructure.

## Audit Schedule

Security audits should be conducted at the following intervals:

- **Weekly**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive security review
- **Quarterly**: Full security audit with penetration testing
- **Ad-hoc**: After major changes to Docker configurations or dependencies

## Audit Components

Each audit should cover the following components:

1. **Docker Images**
   - Base image vulnerabilities
   - Unnecessary packages
   - Outdated dependencies
   - Proper layering
   - Image size optimization

2. **Dockerfiles**
   - Security best practices
   - Multi-stage builds
   - Non-root user execution
   - Minimal permissions
   - Proper COPY/ADD usage
   - Environment variable handling

3. **Docker Compose Files**
   - Network configuration
   - Volume security
   - Environment variable usage
   - Service dependencies
   - Resource constraints

4. **Container Runtime**
   - Container isolation
   - Resource limitations
   - Privilege settings
   - Capability restrictions
   - Read-only filesystems where applicable

5. **Docker Daemon**
   - Configuration security
   - API endpoint protection
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Access controls

## Audit Tools

The following tools should be used for Docker security audits:

1. **Trivy**
   - Purpose: Vulnerability scanning for container images
   - Usage: `trivy image <image-name>`

2. **Hadolint**
   - Purpose: Dockerfile linting
   - Usage: `hadolint <Dockerfile>`

3. **Dockle**
   - Purpose: Container image linting
   - Usage: `dockle <image-name>`

4. **Docker Bench Security**
   - Purpose: CIS benchmark testing
   - Usage: `docker-bench-security`

5. **Anchore Engine**
   - Purpose: Deep container analysis
   - Usage: Through CI/CD pipeline

## Audit Process

### Preparation Phase
1. Identify all Docker assets to be audited
2. Ensure access to all required tools
3. Review previous audit findings
4. Update audit checklist based on new threats or vulnerabilities

### Execution Phase
1. Run automated scanning tools
2. Manually review Dockerfiles and configurations
3. Test container runtime security
4. Verify network and volume security
5. Check for compliance with security policies

### Reporting Phase
1. Document all findings
2. Categorize issues by severity
3. Provide remediation recommendations
4. Create timeline for addressing issues
5. Share report with relevant stakeholders

## Audit Checklist

### Dockerfile Security Checklist
- [ ] Uses specific version tags (not 'latest')
- [ ] Implements multi-stage builds
- [ ] Runs as non-root user
- [ ] Minimizes installed packages
- [ ] Cleans up package manager caches
- [ ] Sets appropriate file permissions
- [ ] Includes health checks
- [ ] Uses COPY instead of ADD when possible
- [ ] Specifies USER directive
- [ ] Implements proper WORKDIR usage

### Container Runtime Checklist
- [ ] Runs with limited capabilities
- [ ] Uses read-only root filesystem where possible
- [ ] Implements resource limits (CPU, memory)
- [ ] Uses seccomp profiles
- [ ] Implements network segmentation
- [ ] Avoids privileged mode
- [ ] Uses volume mounts securely
- [ ] Implements logging
- [ ] Sets appropriate ulimits
- [ ] Uses appropriate restart policies

## Remediation Process

1. **Critical Issues**
   - Address immediately
   - Requires sign-off before deployment

2. **High Severity Issues**
   - Address within 1 week
   - Requires security review

3. **Medium Severity Issues**
   - Address within 2 weeks
   - Include in regular sprint planning

4. **Low Severity Issues**
   - Address within 1 month
   - Document if accepted as risk

## Continuous Improvement

After each audit:
1. Update security documentation
2. Refine audit process
3. Enhance automation
4. Share lessons learned
5. Update training materials

## Conclusion

This Docker security audit plan provides a structured approach to regularly assess and improve the security of Docker implementations in the ALT_LAS project. By following this plan, the team can maintain a strong security posture and address vulnerabilities proactively.
