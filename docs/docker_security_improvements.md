# Docker Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements made to the Docker configurations in the ALT_LAS project. As Worker 8 (Security and DevOps Specialist), I've identified several security vulnerabilities in the existing Dockerfiles and implemented secure alternatives.

## Security Issues Identified

The following security issues were identified in the original Dockerfiles:

1. **Running as Root**: All services were running as the root user inside containers, which is a significant security risk.
2. **Missing Health Checks**: No health checks were implemented, making it difficult to determine container health.
3. **Inefficient Multi-stage Builds**: Most services weren't using multi-stage builds, resulting in larger images with unnecessary build tools.
4. **Improper File Permissions**: No explicit file permissions were set for application files.
5. **Outdated Base Images**: Some services were using base images without specifying exact versions.

## Security Improvements Implemented

For each service, a new `Dockerfile.secure` has been created with the following improvements:

### 1. API Gateway (Node.js)
- Implemented multi-stage build to reduce attack surface
- Created and used non-root user (appuser)
- Set proper file permissions
- Added health check endpoint
- Used specific Alpine-based image versions

### 2. Archive Service (Go)
- Implemented multi-stage build with minimal Alpine image
- Created and used non-root user
- Set proper file permissions
- Added health check endpoint
- Used CGO_ENABLED=0 for static compilation

### 3. Runner Service (Rust)
- Enhanced existing multi-stage build
- Created and used non-root user
- Set proper file permissions
- Added health check endpoint
- Installed only necessary dependencies

### 4. Segmentation Service (Python)
- Implemented multi-stage build
- Created and used non-root user
- Set proper file permissions
- Added health check endpoint
- Minimized installed packages

## Implementation Details

Each secure Dockerfile follows these security best practices:

1. **Multi-stage Builds**:
   - First stage builds the application
   - Second stage includes only necessary runtime components
   - Reduces attack surface and image size

2. **Non-root User**:
   - Creates a dedicated application user and group
   - Runs the application with least privilege

3. **File Permissions**:
   - Sets appropriate ownership for application files
   - Restricts permissions to only what's necessary

4. **Health Checks**:
   - Implements HTTP-based health checks
   - Configures appropriate intervals and timeouts

5. **Dependency Management**:
   - Installs only necessary dependencies
   - Cleans up package manager caches

## Usage Instructions

To use the secure Dockerfiles:

1. Review the new `Dockerfile.secure` files in each service directory
2. Rename them to `Dockerfile` to replace the original versions
3. Rebuild your containers using:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
4. Verify the containers start correctly and health checks pass

## Security Benefits

These improvements provide the following security benefits:

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Smaller images with fewer components mean fewer potential vulnerabilities
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Non-root users limit the impact of container breaches
3. **Improved Monitoring**: Health checks enable better detection of service issues
4. **Enhanced Isolation**: Proper permissions prevent unauthorized access to files

## Next Steps

1. Implement these secure Dockerfiles across all environments
2. Add Docker security scanning to the CI/CD pipeline
3. Create a Docker security policy document
4. Implement regular Docker security audits
