# Docker Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the Docker security policy for the ALT_LAS project. It establishes guidelines, best practices, and requirements for creating and maintaining secure Docker containers across all services.

## Policy Scope
This policy applies to all Docker containers, images, and related infrastructure used in the ALT_LAS project, including:
- All microservices (api-gateway, archive-service, runner-service, segmentation-service, etc.)
- Development, testing, staging, and production environments
- CI/CD pipelines and automation tools

## Security Requirements

### 1. Container Images
- **Base Images**: 
  - Use only official or trusted base images
  - Specify exact version tags (e.g., `node:18-alpine` not just `node:alpine`)
  - Regularly update base images to include security patches
  - Prefer Alpine or slim variants when available

- **Multi-stage Builds**:
  - Implement multi-stage builds for all Dockerfiles
  - Include only necessary artifacts in the final stage
  - Minimize the number of layers to reduce attack surface

- **Non-root Users**:
  - Never run containers as root
  - Create dedicated service users with minimal permissions
  - Set appropriate file permissions for application files
  - Use `USER` directive to switch to non-root user

- **Health Checks**:
  - Implement health checks for all containers
  - Configure appropriate intervals and timeouts
  - Ensure health check endpoints don't expose sensitive information

### 2. Container Runtime Security
- **Resource Limits**:
  - Set memory and CPU limits for all containers
  - Configure appropriate ulimits
  - Implement proper restart policies

- **Network Security**:
  - Expose only necessary ports
  - Use internal networks for service-to-service communication
  - Implement network segmentation

- **Secrets Management**:
  - Never store secrets in Docker images
  - Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management
  - Implement proper secret rotation

- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Configure appropriate logging
  - Implement container monitoring
  - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

### 3. Build and Deployment
- **Security Scanning**:
  - Scan all images for vulnerabilities before deployment
  - Block deployment of images with critical vulnerabilities
  - Regularly scan running containers

- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipelines
  - Implement automated testing for Docker security
  - Maintain audit logs of all image builds and deployments

- **Registry Security**:
  - Use private registries with access controls
  - Implement image signing
  - Regularly clean up unused images

## Security Scanning Tools
The following tools must be used for Docker security scanning:

1. **Trivy**: For vulnerability scanning of container images
2. **Hadolint**: For Dockerfile linting and best practices
3. **Dockle**: For container image linting and CIS benchmarks
4. **Docker Bench Security**: For Docker environment security checks

## Compliance and Auditing
- Conduct quarterly security audits of Docker infrastructure
- Maintain documentation of all security measures
- Review and update this policy every six months

## Incident Response
In case of a container security incident:
1. Isolate the affected container
2. Analyze the breach and its impact
3. Apply necessary fixes
4. Update security measures to prevent similar incidents
5. Document the incident and response

## Responsibilities
- **Development Teams**: Follow secure Dockerfile practices
- **DevOps Team**: Maintain secure Docker infrastructure
- **Security Team**: Regular audits and policy updates
