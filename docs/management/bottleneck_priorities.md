# Immediate Priorities: Addressing Critical Bottlenecks (ALT_LAS)

**Prepared By:** Project Manager
**Date:** May 01, 2025

**Context:**
Based on the latest project progress report (`worker_progress_detailed.md`), the overall progress is at 42%. However, critical bottlenecks exist in the following areas, hindering overall advancement:

*   **Runner Service (Worker 3):** 15% progress. Core functionality like *.alt file processing and AI interaction is not yet implemented.
*   **UI Development (Worker 5):** 0% progress. All UI components (Desktop, Web, Mobile) are pending initiation.
*   **Security Layer (Worker 8):** 0% progress. Core security components (Policy Enforcement, Sandbox Manager, Audit Service) and foundational security measures are pending initiation.

**Objective:**
To accelerate progress in these critical areas, the immediate focus for the upcoming sprint(s) must be on initiating and advancing the core tasks for Workers 3, 5, and 8.

**Immediate Priorities by Worker:**

**Worker 3 (Runner Service):**
*   **Highest Priority:** Begin implementation of the **`*.alt` file processing module using Serde** (Task from original list, High Priority).
*   **Coordinate on:** Foundational security (mTLS, encryption, access control - PM.3.1, PM.3.2), performance metric collection (PM.3.3), and resilience patterns (PM.3.4) as these are implemented across services.
*   **Rationale:** Processing *.alt files is the fundamental input mechanism for the Runner Service. Progress here is essential for downstream tasks and integration.

**Worker 5 (UI Development):**
*   **Highest Priority:** Initiate the **Desktop UI (Electron/React)** development, starting with the basic application structure and core layout (Task from original list, High Priority).
*   **Incorporate Early:** Accessibility standards (WCAG - PM.5.8) and client-side input validation (PM.5.9) from the beginning.
*   **Coordinate on:** Foundational security measures as they relate to UI interactions.
*   **Rationale:** The UI is a major component with 0% progress. Starting the foundational work is critical for user interaction and testing other components.

**Worker 8 (Security Layer & DevOps):**
*   **Highest Priority (Security):** Begin implementation of the **Policy Enforcement** component (Task from original list, High Priority) and initiate **Threat Modeling** (PM.8.2).
*   **Highest Priority (Foundational Security):** Lead the implementation of **secure service-to-service communication (mTLS), least privilege access, data encryption, and access controls** across core services (PM.8.1, PM.8.4).
*   **Highest Priority (DevOps):** Integrate **security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)** into the CI/CD pipeline (PM.8.5).
*   **Coordinate on:** Developing security test cases with QA (PM.8.3).
*   **Rationale:** The security layer is fundamental to the project's integrity and has 0% progress. Foundational security measures need to be implemented early across the architecture.

**Next Steps:**

1.  These priorities will be formally incorporated into the upcoming Sprint Planning document (Step 3).
2.  Workers 3, 5, and 8 should align their immediate work based on these priorities, referring to their updated task lists (`todo_workerX.md`).
3.  Regular stand-ups will monitor progress specifically on these bottleneck areas.
