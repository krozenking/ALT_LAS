# Project Manager Action Plan (ALT_LAS - May 1, 2025)

**Role:** Project Manager

**Based on:** Review of `worker_progress_detailed.md` (Overall Progress: 42%)

**Assessment:**

The project shows progress in several areas, notably Segmentation Service (Worker 2, 95%) and good advancement in API Gateway (Worker 1, 75%), Archive Service (Worker 4, 75%), and OS Integration (Worker 6, 70%). However, critical bottlenecks and risks exist:

1.  **Runner Service (Worker 3 - 15%):** This core service is significantly behind schedule. Its function is critical for processing tasks and interacting with the AI layer, making this the primary bottleneck.
2.  **UI Development (Worker 5 - 0%):** No work has commenced on any UI components (Desktop, Web, Mobile). This is a major risk as UI is essential for user interaction and testing.
3.  **Security Layer (Worker 8 - 0%):** Development of the security layer (Policy Enforcement, Sandbox Manager, Audit Service) has not started. Security is paramount for a system like ALT_LAS.
4.  **AI Layer (Worker 7 - 50%):** While progress has been made on core orchestration and LLM integration, crucial components like Computer Vision and Voice Processing services remain untouched.

**Identified Risks:**

*   **Schedule Slippage:** Significant delays in Runner Service, UI, and Security put the 32-week target for Version 1.0 at high risk.
*   **Integration Challenges:** The lack of progress on core components will likely cause cascading delays during integration phases.
*   **Incomplete Core Functionality:** Without Runner Service, UI, and Security, the system cannot achieve its core objectives or be adequately tested.

**Immediate Action Plan:**

1.  **Investigate Runner Service Delay (Worker 3):**
    *   **Action:** Immediately communicate with Worker 3 to understand the reasons for the 15% progress status.
    *   **Objective:** Identify blockers (technical challenges, resource needs, unclear requirements) and provide necessary support.
    *   **Priority:** Highest.

2.  **Initiate UI Development (Worker 5):**
    *   **Action:** Confirm Worker 5 has all necessary resources, design specifications (referencing UI/UX Designer and previous UI recommendations), and a clear starting point (Electron/React base structure).
    *   **Objective:** Ensure UI development commences immediately, focusing initially on the Desktop UI structure.
    *   **Priority:** High.

3.  **Initiate Security Layer Development (Worker 8):**
    *   **Action:** Confirm Worker 8 has the necessary setup and understanding to begin work on Policy Enforcement using Rust.
    *   **Objective:** Start development of the security layer without further delay.
    *   **Priority:** High.

4.  **Prioritize AI Component Development (Worker 7):**
    *   **Action:** Discuss with Worker 7 the plan for starting Computer Vision and Voice Processing service development alongside ongoing orchestration tasks.
    *   **Objective:** Ensure these key AI capabilities are addressed in upcoming sprints.
    *   **Priority:** Medium.

5.  **Monitor Near-Completion Tasks (Workers 1, 2, 4, 6):**
    *   **Action:** Ensure Workers 1, 4, and 6 focus on their remaining tasks (integration, CI/CD, performance). Confirm Worker 2 completes final integration tests.
    *   **Objective:** Finalize these components to free up resources and reduce integration risks later.
    *   **Priority:** Medium.

6.  **Team Communication:**
    *   **Action:** Schedule a brief team meeting (or use asynchronous communication) to reiterate priorities, focusing on unblocking Worker 3 and starting Workers 5 & 8.
    *   **Objective:** Ensure alignment and transparency across the team regarding current priorities and risks.

**Next Steps:**

*   Execute communication actions with Workers 3, 5, 7, and 8.
*   Update `worker_progress_detailed.md` based on feedback and task initiation.
*   Re-evaluate the project timeline and milestones based on the findings and report risks to stakeholders if necessary.
