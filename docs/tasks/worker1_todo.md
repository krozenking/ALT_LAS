# Worker 1 (Backend Leader) Todo List

This list outlines the tasks for Worker 1, focusing on the API Gateway and backend coordination.

**Note:** Following the deletion of all non-main branches (Apr 30, 2025), tasks previously marked as complete based on work in those branches have been reset to incomplete `[ ]` or partially complete `[/]` for review. All future work must be done directly on the `main` branch.

## Tasks

- [X] **1. Review Existing Implementation:** (Assuming initial review was done on main or is still valid)
    - [X] Review API Gateway setup and configuration (`index.js`, Dockerfiles).
    - [X] Review Authentication/Authorization (`middleware/authenticateJWT.js`, `services/authService.js`).
    - [X] Review API Documentation (`swagger.yaml`, integration in `index.js`).
    - [X] Review Rate Limiting and Security (`middleware/rateLimiter.js`, `helmet` usage).
    - [X] Review Service Discovery (`services/serviceDiscovery.js`).
    - [X] Review API Versioning (`middleware/apiVersioning.js`).
- [/] **2. Enhance Authentication/Authorization:** (Replaced insecure password hashing with bcrypt)
    - [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if needed. (Needs review on main)
    - [ ] Consider token refresh mechanisms. (Needs review on main)
- [ ] **3. Update API Documentation:**
    - [ ] Ensure `swagger.yaml` accurately reflects all endpoints and data models on `main`.
    - [ ] Add detailed descriptions and examples.
- [ ] **4. Enhance Service Discovery:**
    - [ ] Evaluate if the current in-memory discovery is sufficient or if a more robust solution (e.g., Consul, etcd) is needed for production.
    - [ ] Implement health checks for registered services beyond the basic heartbeat. (Needs review on main)
- [ ] **5. Implement Performance Monitoring:**
    - [ ] Integrate performance monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus client, APM) on `main`.
    - [ ] Add logging for key performance metrics.
- [ ] **6. Refine API Versioning:**
    - [ ] Ensure the versioning strategy is consistently applied and documented on `main`.
- [ ] **7. Coordinate CI/CD:**
    - [ ] Collaborate with Worker 8 (DevOps) to ensure the API Gateway is properly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for `main`.
    - [ ] Provide necessary build/deployment scripts or configurations.
- [/] **8. Testing:** (Tests failed due to unrelated TypeScript errors in commandRoutes.ts - missing express-validator and type mismatch)
    - [ ] Review existing tests (`tests/` directory) in the context of `main`.
    - [ ] Add more comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for `main`.
- [ ] **9. Documentation:**
    - [ ] Create and maintain `docs/worker1_documentation.md` as per project guidelines using `worker_documentation_template.md` (Add new rules section).
