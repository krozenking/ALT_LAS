# Worker Completion Percentage Summary

This document provides an estimated completion percentage for each worker based on the analysis of task lists (`worker_tasks.md`, `todo_worker*.md`, `todo.md`), commit history, and available documentation (`docs/worker*_documentation.md`) as of April 29, 2025.

**Note:** These percentages are estimates based on available data. Discrepancies between documentation and actual code, as well as the lack of detailed documentation for some workers, may affect accuracy.

- **Worker 1 (Backend Lider - API Gateway): 55%**
  - Significant progress on basic infrastructure, authentication/authorization, and service integration.
  - Major areas like advanced API development, performance optimization, WebSocket support, and full testing remain largely incomplete.

- **Worker 2 (Segmentation Uzmanı): 65%**
  - Codebase suggests more progress than the todo list indicates, particularly in DSL, parsing, and NLP enhancements.
  - Testing coverage, full Mod/Persona integration, segmentation algorithm refinement, and performance optimization application need verification and completion.

- **Worker 3 (Runner Geliştirici): 90%**
  - Core functionalities (ALT/LAST processing, AI calls, parallel tasks, FFI) appear largely complete according to documentation.
  - Remaining tasks involve FFI examples for more languages, extensive testing, and performance benchmarking.

- **Worker 4 (Archive ve Veri Yönetimi Uzmanı): 5%**
  - Minimal to no progress identified in commit history or documentation.
  - Core tasks for the Archive Service seem not to have started.

- **Worker 5 (UI/UX Geliştirici): 45%**
  - Good progress on basic setup, core components, accessibility, performance optimization, and initial animations.
  - Major features like the notification system, advanced screen capture/recording, adaptive layouts, and comprehensive UI documentation are pending.

- **Worker 6 (OS Entegrasyon Uzmanı): 20%**
  - Initial service setup is complete.
  - Core tasks involving Windows, macOS, and Linux integration modules are in the early stages (15-20% documented progress).
  - Advanced features (screen capture, input control, OCR) and CI/CD setup are pending.

- **Worker 7 (AI Uzmanı): 70%**
  - Significant features like Computer Vision, Speech Processing, and Multi-Model Orchestration seem implemented based on commit history.
  - Detailed status of Local LLM integration, model optimization, performance monitoring, and comprehensive testing is unclear due to lack of specific documentation/todo.

- **Worker 8 (Güvenlik ve DevOps Uzmanı): 80%**
  - Substantial progress in Docker security, Kubernetes security integration, and CI/CD security enhancements.
  - Remaining tasks include Docker audit automation, security test automation, training materials, and other general DevOps tasks (monitoring, logging).
