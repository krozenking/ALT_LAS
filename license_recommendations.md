## License Requirements for Commercial Use

While no replacements are needed, the team should ensure the following requirements are met for license compliance:

### For MIT Licensed Libraries
- Include the original copyright notice and license text in your software distribution
- This can be done by maintaining a "licenses" or "third-party notices" file in your project

### For BSD Licensed Libraries (uvicorn)
- Include the original copyright notice
- Include the license text
- Do not use the names of the copyright holders or contributors to endorse derived products without permission

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **License Tracking**: Implement a process to track licenses of new dependencies before they are added to the project
2. **License Documentation**: Maintain an up-to-date document listing all third-party libraries and their licenses
3. **Dependency Review**: Conduct periodic reviews of dependencies to ensure continued license compliance
4. **License Education**: Ensure all team members understand which licenses are compatible with the project's commercial goals

## Conclusion
The ALT_LAS project is currently in full compliance with license requirements for closed-source commercial use. No immediate actions are required regarding license compatibility.
