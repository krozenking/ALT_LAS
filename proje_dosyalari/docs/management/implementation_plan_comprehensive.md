# Implementation Plan for Prioritized Comprehensive Suggestions (ALT_LAS)

**Source:** `/prioritized_comprehensive_suggestions.md`
**Prepared By:** Project Manager

This plan outlines the integration of the prioritized suggestions from the comprehensive recommendations into the ALT_LAS project workflow. It considers the current project status (42% overall progress, critical bottlenecks in Runner Service, UI, and Security) and aims to address foundational issues while integrating valuable enhancements.

**Integration Strategy:**

*   **Priority 1 tasks** will be integrated into the **immediate next sprints (Sprint X, X+1)**, running in parallel with efforts to unblock critical path items (Runner Service, UI, Security initiation).
*   **Priority 2 tasks** will be integrated into **subsequent sprints (Sprint X+2, X+3)**, following the stabilization of foundational elements and core component progress.
*   **Priority 3 tasks** will be scheduled for **later sprints or post-Beta phase**, once core functionality is robust.

**Sprint Integration (Illustrative - Assuming Current Sprint is ending):**

**Sprint X & X+1 (Focus: Foundations, Unblocking, Security Baseline):**

*   **Parallel to:** Unblocking Worker 3 (Runner Service), Initiating Worker 5 (UI), Initiating Worker 8 (Security).
*   **Priority 1 Tasks Integration:**
    *   **Security (Worker 8 Lead, All Workers):** Begin Threat Modeling (8), Implement mTLS/Least Privilege (All), Implement Data Encryption/Access Controls (All). *Initial focus on core services.*
    *   **DevOps/All:** Establish Performance Metric Collection (DevOps/All), Integrate Security Scans in CI/CD (DevOps), Automate Builds/Packaging (DevOps).
    *   **QA/Worker 8:** Develop initial Security Test Cases (QA/8).
    *   **QA/All:** Continue expanding Unit/Integration Test Coverage (All).
    *   **PM/Product:** Define initial SLOs (PM/Product).
    *   **PM/Legal:** Verify Dependency Licenses (PM/Legal).

**Sprint X+2 & X+3 (Focus: Component Quality, Process Enhancement):**

*   **Parallel to:** Continued development on Runner Service, UI, Security Layer, AI Components.
*   **Priority 2 Tasks Integration:**
    *   **AI (Worker 7, QA, Worker 8):** Integrate MLOps tools (7), Implement AI Data Privacy measures (7/8), Develop AI Bias/Robustness tests (QA/7).
    *   **Archive/AI (Worker 4, Worker 7):** Verify *.atlas feedback loop implementation (4/7).
    *   **UI/QA (Worker 5, QA):** Implement Accessibility standards (WCAG) (5), Implement UI Test Automation (QA/5), Conduct Cross-Platform UI Tests (QA/5).
    *   **UI (Worker 5):** Implement Client-Side Input Validation (5).
    *   **QA/All:** Implement Service-Specific Performance/Load Tests (QA/All).

**Later Sprints / Post-Beta (Focus: Advanced Quality & Enhancements):**

*   **Priority 3 Tasks Integration:**
    *   **QA/DevOps:** Introduce Chaos Engineering practices (QA/DevOps).
    *   **UI (Worker 5):** Refine Native Look-and-Feel / OS Integration (5).

**Key Considerations & Dependencies:**

*   **Worker Availability:** Integration depends on workers' capacity alongside their primary component tasks. Security and process tasks often require collaboration.
*   **Bottleneck Resolution:** Progress on Runner Service, UI, and Security remains the highest overall project priority. These foundational tasks support, but do not replace, that focus.
*   **CI/CD Maturity:** Effective implementation of automated testing and security scanning relies on a stable CI/CD pipeline (Worker 1, DevOps task).
*   **SLOs:** Defined SLOs will guide performance tuning and resilience efforts.

**Communication:**

*   These integrated tasks will be discussed during the next Sprint Planning meeting.
*   Individual worker task lists (`workerX_todo.md` or similar) need to be updated to reflect these assignments (this plan serves as the high-level guide).

**Next Step:** Communicate these decisions and the high-level plan to the user.
