# Prioritized Comprehensive Suggestions (ALT_LAS)

**Source:** `/selected_comprehensive_suggestions.md`
**Prioritized By:** Project Manager

Based on the selected comprehensive suggestions and the current project status (Overall Progress: 42%, Bottlenecks: Runner Service, UI, Security), the following prioritization has been established. The focus is on addressing foundational security, stability, quality, and process improvements first, followed by enhancements to specific components and longer-term quality initiatives.

**Priority 1 (Highest - Foundational Security, Stability, Process):**

*   **Security 1.4:** Implement secure service-to-service communication (e.g., mTLS) and enforce least privilege access across all services. (Assign: Relevant Workers, Lead: Worker 8)
*   **Security 4.4:** Conduct thorough threat modeling. Review sandbox implementation effectiveness and plan for future penetration testing. (Assign: Worker 8)
*   **DevOps 4.5:** Integrate security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) into the CI/CD pipeline. (Assign: DevOps/Relevant Workers)
*   **QA 4.6:** Develop and execute security-focused test cases (negative tests, authorization, potential sandbox escapes). (Assign: QA, Worker 8)
*   **Security 6.4:** Implement robust data access controls and ensure encryption for data at rest and in transit. (Assign: Relevant Workers, Lead: Worker 8)
*   **Data Scientist 1.10:** Establish robust collection and analysis of performance metrics (latency, error rates, resource usage) for all services. (Assign: DevOps/Relevant Workers)
*   **DevOps 9.5 / SW Arch 9.2:** Enhance infrastructure resilience (replication, failover) and implement patterns like circuit breakers/retries for critical service interactions. (Assign: DevOps/Relevant Workers)
*   **DevOps 7.5:** Continuously tune infrastructure (resource allocation, network configuration) based on performance data. (Assign: DevOps)
*   **DevOps 5.5:** Automate cross-platform build, packaging, and deployment processes. (Assign: DevOps/Relevant Workers)
*   **QA 8.2:** Continuously work towards expanding test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) across all components. (Assign: All Workers, QA)
*   **Product Manager 7.7:** Define clear Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for performance and availability. (Assign: Project Manager, Product Manager)
*   **Legal 10.8:** Verify that all dependencies and the overall project structure align with the intended commercial licensing strategy. (Assign: Project Manager, Legal)

**Priority 2 (High - Component Quality & Core Process Enhancement):**

*   **AI Engineer 2.2:** Integrate MLOps tools for monitoring AI model performance (accuracy, speed, resource use). Plan for using *.atlas data for future model fine-tuning. (Assign: Worker 7)
*   **Security 2.4:** Ensure data privacy when sending data to AI models (anonymization/masking where needed). Investigate defenses against common AI attacks. (Assign: Worker 7, Worker 8)
*   **QA 2.6:** Develop test sets and metrics to evaluate AI model bias and robustness. (Assign: QA, Worker 7)
*   **AI Engineer 6.10:** Ensure the *.atlas feedback loop mechanism is correctly implemented for learning from successful tasks. (Assign: Worker 4, Worker 7)
*   **UI/UX Designer 3.3 / QA 8.3:** Prioritize Accessibility (WCAG compliance) throughout UI development. Implement UI test automation. (Assign: Worker 5, QA)
*   **Security 3.4:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the client-side (UI). (Assign: Worker 5)
*   **QA 3.6 / QA 5.6:** Conduct comprehensive UI testing across supported platforms, browsers, and OS versions. (Assign: QA, Worker 5)
*   **QA 1.6:** Implement performance and load testing specific to each microservice. (Assign: QA, Relevant Workers)

**Priority 3 (Medium - Further Enhancements & Long-term Quality):**

*   **QA 9.6:** Introduce chaos engineering practices to test system resilience against failures. (Assign: QA, DevOps)
*   **UI/UX Designer 5.3:** Balance native look-and-feel with ALT_LAS brand identity; ensure effective use of OS integrations (tray, notifications). (Assign: Worker 5)

**Next Step:** Create an implementation plan outlining how these prioritized tasks will be integrated into the existing project roadmap and assigned sprints, considering worker availability and dependencies.
