# ALT_LAS Sprint X Planning Document

**Prepared By:** Project Manager
**Date:** May 01, 2025
**Sprint Duration:** [Specify Duration, e.g., 2 Weeks]

**Sprint Goal:**
Initiate core development for UI (Worker 5) and Security Layer (Worker 8). Significantly advance Runner Service (Worker 3) by implementing *.alt file processing. Implement foundational security measures (mTLS, access control, encryption) and integrate security scanning into CI/CD. Establish performance metric collection and define initial SLOs.

**Key Focus Areas:**
1.  **Unblock Critical Components:** Runner Service, UI, Security Layer.
2.  **Establish Security Baseline:** Implement Priority 1 security tasks across services.
3.  **Improve Process & Infrastructure:** CI/CD security, performance monitoring, build automation.

**Sprint Review & Retrospective:**
*   A Sprint Review will be held at the end of the sprint to demonstrate completed work.
*   A Sprint Retrospective will follow to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and actions for the next sprint.

**Next Step:** Update the overall project roadmap based on this sprint plan and communicate updates.
