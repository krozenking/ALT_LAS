# Selected UI/UX Improvements for Implementation (ALT_LAS)

**Source:** `/ui_improvement_suggestions.md`
**Selected By:** Project Manager

Based on the review of the UI/UX improvement suggestions and considering the current project status (overall 42% progress, with critical bottlenecks in Runner Service, UI, and Security), the following improvements have been selected for implementation. The focus is on enhancing core usability, accessibility, and consistency, while aligning with existing roadmap items where possible.

**Selected Improvements:**

1.  **Glassmorphism Effects - Consistency & Accessibility:**
    *   **Task:** Develop a clear style guide defining parameters (blur, opacity, radius) for consistent application of glassmorphism across all relevant UI components.
    *   **Task:** Review glassmorphism implementation against WCAG contrast and readability guidelines. Define adjustments or alternatives for high-contrast themes and ensure text/icons remain legible.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures visual consistency and addresses potential accessibility issues early.

2.  **Panel System - Usability Enhancements:**
    *   **Task:** Implement enhanced visual feedback during panel drag-and-drop and resizing operations (e.g., highlighted drop zones, ghost panels).
    *   **Task:** Define and implement keyboard shortcuts for navigating between panels, resizing panels, and initiating drag/drop actions.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves core interaction usability and accessibility, building on the existing panel system.

3.  **Command Bar - Interaction Feedback:**
    *   **Task:** Implement visual feedback (e.g., loading indicator, subtle animation) within the command bar while a command is being processed by the backend.
    *   **Task:** Design and implement user-friendly error messages for invalid commands or backend processing errors, potentially suggesting corrections.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides crucial feedback to the user about system status and errors, improving the command interaction experience.

4.  **Theme System - Mode Integration:**
    *   **Task:** Implement distinct visual variations within the theme system for the different operating modes (Normal, Dream, Explore, Chaos), going beyond simple color changes if feasible (e.g., subtle animation differences, UI element styling).
    *   **Rationale:** Aligns with the existing roadmap (`ui_recommendations.md`) and Worker 5's planned tasks for theme system development, making the modes visually distinct.

**Deferred/Lower Priority Suggestions (for now):**

*   Glassmorphism Performance Tuning (Already part of Worker 5's plan)
*   Panel System: Layout Save/Load UI, Grouping/Tab Logic (Larger features, defer)
*   Command Bar: Rich Result Integration (High coordination needed, address UI part first or defer slightly)
*   Theme System: Additional dimensions (icons, sounds), Sharing (Lower priority)
*   User Onboarding: Interactive Tour, Example Scenarios (Defer until core UI is stable)
*   Micro-interactions: General polish (Defer until core functionality is complete)

**Next Step:** Prioritize these selected tasks and assign them to the appropriate workers (primarily Worker 5, with potential coordination needed for Command Bar tasks).
