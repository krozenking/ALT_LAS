# Worker 1 (Backend Leader) Todo List

This list outlines the tasks for Worker 1, focusing on the API Gateway and backend coordination.

## Tasks

- [X] **1. Review Existing Implementation:**
    - [X] Review API Gateway setup and configuration (`index.js`, Dockerfiles).
    - [X] Review Authentication/Authorization (`middleware/authenticateJWT.js`, `services/authService.js`).
    - [X] Review API Documentation (`swagger.yaml`, integration in `index.js`).
    - [X] Review Rate Limiting and Security (`middleware/rateLimiter.js`, `helmet` usage).
    - [X] Review Service Discovery (`services/serviceDiscovery.js`).
    - [X] Review API Versioning (`middleware/apiVersioning.js`).
- [X] **2. Enhance Authentication/Authorization:**
    - [/] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if needed. (Partially done for service discovery routes)
    - [X] Consider token refresh mechanisms.
- [X] **3. Update API Documentation:**
    - [X] Ensure `swagger.yaml` accurately reflects all endpoints and data models.
    - [X] Add detailed descriptions and examples.
- [X] **4. Enhance Service Discovery:**
    - [X] Evaluate if the current in-memory discovery is sufficient or if a more robust solution (e.g., Consul, etcd) is needed for production.
    - [X] Implement health checks for registered services beyond the basic heartbeat.
- [X] **5. Implement Performance Monitoring:**
    - [X] Integrate performance monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus client, APM).
    - [X] Add logging for key performance metrics.
- [ ] **6. Refine API Versioning:**
    - [ ] Ensure the versioning strategy is consistently applied and documented.
- [ ] **7. Coordinate CI/CD:**
    - [ ] Collaborate with Worker 8 (DevOps) to ensure the API Gateway is properly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    - [ ] Provide necessary build/deployment scripts or configurations.
- [ ] **8. Testing:**
    - [ ] Review existing tests (`tests/` directory).
    - [ ] Add more comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- [ ] **9. Documentation:**
    - [ ] Create and maintain `docs/worker1_documentation.md` as per project guidelines using `worker_documentation_template.md`.
