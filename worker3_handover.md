# Handover Document - Worker 3 (Runner Service)

**Date:** 2025-04-28

**From:** Worker 3

**To:** Next Worker assigned to Runner Service tasks

## Summary of Work Completed

My primary task was to implement the assigned functionalities for the `runner-service` component of the ALT_LAS project and ensure the code compiles without errors, addressing the user's requirement for zero errors and warnings.

I have completed the following:

1.  Implemented core components for the runner service based on the initial task list (though specific implementations might need further refinement).
2.  Addressed numerous compilation errors, including:
    *   Missing dependencies (`rayon`, `flate2`, `reqwest`, `futures`).
    *   Incorrect type annotations (`FileOptions` in `last_file/writer.rs`).
    *   Unresolved imports and incorrect module references (`MockAiServiceClient`).
    *   Syntax errors (escape characters).
    *   Missing system dependencies (`libssl-dev`).
3.  Fixed several initial warnings related to unused imports and variables.
4.  Successfully pushed all corrected code to the `main` branch on GitHub.

## Current Status

The `runner-service` code now compiles successfully using `cargo check`.

However, there are remaining **warnings** related to **unused code**. The user explicitly requested **zero errors and zero warnings**. Therefore, these warnings must be addressed.

## Next Steps (Handover)

The immediate next task is to eliminate all remaining compiler warnings.

I have documented the specific warnings and suggested steps for resolution in the following file:

*   `runner-service/remaining_warnings.md`

Please review this document carefully. It details the unused structs, fields, and functions identified by `cargo check`.

**Your primary goal is to follow the steps outlined in `remaining_warnings.md` to achieve a state where `cargo check` reports zero errors and zero warnings.**

Good luck!
